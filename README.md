# 🧭 Advanced Couchbase Documentation by Ravi Veliyat

### A hands-on documentation and learning project built as part of my preparation for the **Senior Technical Writer** interview at Couchbase.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository explores **advanced Couchbase concepts** through developer-focused documentation and practical examples.

Each topic is written from a **technical communicator’s perspective** — combining conceptual clarity, procedural precision, and reference-level detail — supported by diagrams, sample code, and (soon) YouTube walkthroughs.

The goal is to create documentation that is:
- **Deeper** than quick-start guides,
- **Simpler** than dense technical papers, and  
- **Structured** for readers who want to *understand* before they *apply*.

## 📘 Topics

| No | Folder | Title | Doc Type | Description |
|----|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 01 | [`01-vbuckets-data-distribution`](./01-vbuckets-data-distribution/index.md) | Understanding vBuckets and Data Distribution | **Conceptual** | Explains Couchbase’s distributed architecture, vBuckets, and rebalancing — with visuals and analogies. |
| 02 | [`02-n1ql-query-optimization`](./02-n1ql-query-optimization/index.md) | N1QL Query Optimization and Index Selection | **Procedural** | Step-by-step guide to analyzing `EXPLAIN` plans, understanding index coverage, and tuning performance. |
| 03 | [`03-crud-sdk-nodejs`](./03-crud-sdk-nodejs/index.md) | CRUD Operations with Couchbase SDK (Node.js) | **Reference** | A developer-friendly guide for connecting to Couchbase, performing CRUD operations, and handling common errors. |

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This repo is part of my structured prep journey documented in [`PREP_TRACKER.md`](./PREP_TRACKER.md).  
It combines three skill areas essential to modern technical communication:

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 🪶 **Technical Writing** | Crafting conceptual, procedural, and reference content with clarity and structure. |
| 🗄️ **Database Knowledge** | Building fluency in Couchbase internals and distributed data models. |
| 💾 **Query Practice (SQL + NoSQL)** | Reinforcing fundamentals through HackerRank challenges and N1QL experimentation. |

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Stack

| Area | Tool / Platform |
|------|------------------|
| Authoring | Markdown in VSCode |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |
| Visualization | Mermaid / Draw.io |
| Optional Site Generator | MkDocs (Material Theme) |
| Database Practice | HackerRank (SQL + NoSQL) + Couchbase Capella |
| Video Hosting | YouTube Playlist *(coming soon)* |

---

## 🎥 YouTube Series (Planned)

This documentation series will later include companion explainer videos:
1. **Understanding vBuckets and Data Distribution**  
2. **Optimizing N1QL Queries and Indexing**  
3. **CRUD with the Couchbase Node.js SDK**

Each topic will link to its video under a `video.md` file.

## 🧾 Progress & Reflections

Ongoing progress and daily reflections are tracked in [`PREP_TRACKER.md`](./PREP_TRACKER.md).  
That file logs milestones, HackerRank learnings (SQL + NoSQL), and writing takeaways during the preparation phase.

---

## 🌐 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add diagrams and visuals for each topic.  
- [ ] Embed YouTube walkthroughs for every document.  
- [ ] Publish static version using **MkDocs + Material** for clean navigation.  
- [ ] Expand with more advanced Couchbase topics: XDCR, Eventing, Analytics.  
- [ ] Open contributions for community feedback.
