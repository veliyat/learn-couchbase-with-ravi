## 🧠 Learning Focus

### 🪶 Technical Writing Skill Goals
- [ ] Practice **information layering** (Concept → Task → Reference).
- [ ] Refine **tone for developer audiences** — concise, active, accurate.
- [ ] Improve **procedural clarity** — one action per step, clear expected outcome.
- [ ] Maintain **consistent formatting** and syntax highlighting.
- [ ] End each doc with **Key Takeaways** for quick scanning.
- [ ] Create **one visual diagram** per topic (Mermaid / Draw.io).

---

### 🗄️ Database Knowledge Goals (SQL + NoSQL)
#### **SQL via HackerRank**
- [ ] Complete 10–12 SQL challenges focusing on:
  - SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and Subqueries.
  - Query performance and EXPLAIN analysis.
  - Normalization vs. denormalization.
- [ ] Document takeaways from each solved problem in brief notes.
- [ ] Write a short reflection on how relational query planning translates into N1QL logic.

#### **NoSQL via HackerRank / Conceptual Study**
- [ ] Review and practice questions on:
  - Key-Value operations and document retrieval.
  - Data modeling in JSON (hierarchical vs. tabular).
  - Indexing and querying in document stores.
- [ ] Study Couchbase’s:
  - vBuckets, Buckets, Scopes, and Collections.
  - Consistency and replication models.
  - Query behavior with N1QL (SQL-for-JSON).
- [ ] Write comparative notes:
  - “How SQL Joins translate to document relationships.”
  - “When denormalization is a feature, not a flaw.”

#### **Integration Goal**
- [ ] Create a combined summary:  
  *“From SQL to NoSQL — Bridging the Querying Mindset”*  
  explaining how SQL fundamentals influence N1QL query design.

## 🧰 Tools & Workflow
- **Authoring:** Markdown (VSCode)  
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub  
- **Static Site (optional):** MkDocs + Material theme  
- **Diagramming:** Mermaid / Draw.io  
- **Database Practice:** HackerRank (SQL + NoSQL categories)  
- **Couchbase Learning:** Official docs + Capella free trial (if possible)

## 🧩 Daily Progress Log

### 📅 **Day 1 – Repo Setup + vBuckets Documentation**
- [ ] Create GitHub repo and folder structure.  
- [ ] Write conceptual doc on vBuckets and Data Distribution.  
- [ ] Add one diagram (vbucket-to-node mapping).  
- [ ] Commit and push with message:  
  `Added vBuckets conceptual documentation with architecture overview.`  
- [ ] Read Couchbase architecture overview & vBucket distribution docs.  

🧠 *Reflection:*  
What did I learn about Couchbase’s distributed architecture and how it differs from sharded databases?

---

### 📅 **Day 2 – N1QL Query Optimization + HackerRank (SQL + NoSQL)**
- [ ] Write procedural doc on N1QL Query Optimization.  
- [ ] Include EXPLAIN query example and describe index usage.  
- [ ] Document common pitfalls (e.g., full scan vs. covered index).  
- [ ] Complete at least 5 SQL problems and 2–3 NoSQL conceptual exercises.  
- [ ] Write mapping notes:  
  “SQL WHERE → N1QL FILTER,”  
  “SQL JOIN → N1QL NEST/UNNEST.”  
- [ ] Commit progress with:  
  `Added N1QL procedural documentation and HackerRank learning notes.`  

🧠 *Reflection:*  
How does N1QL’s optimizer handle queries differently from traditional SQL databases?

---

### 📅 **Day 3 – CRUD SDK Documentation + Review**
- [ ] Write reference doc for CRUD SDK (Node.js).  
- [ ] Include all 4 operations + error handling section.  
- [x] Test small snippets if possible.  
- [ ] Summarize best practices for SDK-based access.  
- [ ] Review all documents for consistency, tone, and flow.  
- [ ] Optional: Summarize top 3 HackerRank learnings in README.  
- [ ] Final commit before interview with:  
  `Finalized CRUD SDK doc and consolidated learning reflections.`  

🧠 *Reflection:*  
What do I now understand about how SDKs interact with distributed NoSQL databases like Couchbase?

---

## 🗃️ Post-Interview Enhancements
- [ ] Record and upload YouTube videos for each topic.  
- [ ] Embed videos into respective `video.md` files.  
- [ ] Add navigation table to `README.md`.  
- [ ] Optionally publish via GitHub Pages or MkDocs.  
- [ ] Consider writing a LinkedIn post summarizing the documentation journey.  

---

## 🧩 Notes
- Focus on **depth over breadth** — master core Couchbase mechanisms.  
- Treat each document as a **teaching resource** for others.  
- Keep reflections concise — they’ll help you articulate insights clearly during interviews.  
- Verify each technical statement with Couchbase official docs or SDK behavior.
